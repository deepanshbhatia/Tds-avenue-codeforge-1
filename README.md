Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their services, enabling proactive steps to retain them. The project uses a dataset with customer information and applies machine learning techniques to classify whether a customer will churn or not.

Libraries and Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
sklearn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
